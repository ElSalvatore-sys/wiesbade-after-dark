## Company Background

### Founding Story

Partiful was co-founded by **Shreya Murthy** (CEO) and **Joy Tao** who met while working as software engineers at Palantir Technologies. The platform emerged from their observation that Facebook Events "no one was using anymore" and the perverse incentives of social media platforms.

Joy Tao explained their motivation: *"For me, driving more people to spend more time staring at their phone, staring at this endless feed of content, wasn't super motivating, wasn't super meaningful to me personally."* The goal became "bringing people together in person" - ironically launching right as the pandemic demanded the opposite.

**Funding Rounds:**
- **Series A1 (Late 2022):** $20 million led by Andreessen Horowitz
  - Pre-money valuation: $120 million

**Current Team:** 25 employees (as of 2025)
