## 📝 Key Lessons Learned

### What Went Well:
- Owner PWA delivered on time and fully functional

- Mock services need to be clearly distinguished from real ones

### Moving Forward:
- Launch what's ready (PWA) immediately
- Fix what's not (iOS app) properly before submission
- Test everything on real devices before claiming completion
- Be honest about status to avoid wasted €99 and App Review rejection
