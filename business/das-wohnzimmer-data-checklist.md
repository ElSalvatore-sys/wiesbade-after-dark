## Red Flags to Watch For

- Impact: Delays, potential ghost
- Response: "Can we schedule a call with [person] this week?"

⚠️ **They want to change everything**
- Signal: "Can you add X, Y, Z features before we start?"
- Impact: Scope creep, delays
- Response: "Let's start with core features, then iterate based on feedback"

⚠️ **No budget awareness**
- Signal: "What does it cost?" (after seeing pitch with pricing)
- Impact: Sticker shock, didn't pay attention
- Response: Re-emphasize 3-month free pilot, ROI math

⚠️ **Staff is hostile to idea**
- Signal: Eye rolls, "This won't work here," resistance
